Roman Numeral to Integer Converter
Overview
This project includes a Python class Solution which contains a method romanToInt that converts a string representing a Roman numeral into its integer equivalent. This method is particularly useful for understanding Roman numerals and their usage in modern computing contexts.

Features
* Converts Roman numerals to integers.
* Handles subtractive notation (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9).
* Supports all standard Roman numeral symbols (I, V, X, L, C, D, M).

Requirements
* Python 3.x

Usage
* To use the romanToInt method, first import the Solution class, create an instance of it, and then call the romanToInt method with a Roman numeral string as an argument.
